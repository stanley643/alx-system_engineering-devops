The OSI model
The OSI model is conceptual model that provides common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of system interconnection.

The communication between systems is divided into seven different abstraction layers:

1. Physical layer
2. Data Link layer
3. Network layer
4. Transport layer
5. Session layer
6. Presentation layer
7. Application layer
It is organized from the highest to the lowest level.

LAN
The Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that connects computers within a limited area.

The following are some of the uses of LAN:

- File sharing
- Printer sharing
- Internet access sharing
- Email and messaging
- Network gaming
WAN
This is a computer network that covers a broad area, typically spanning to multiple geographic locations.

The following are some of its uses:

- Interconnecting branch offices
- remote access
- internet connectivity 
- wide area file sharing
- unifies comminication
- disaster recovery and data replication
IP Address
A unique number that identifies each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

Types of IP Addresses
There are two most well-known types of IP address:

1. IPV4
    This type of addresses consist of four sets of numbers separated by periods, for example, 192.168.1.1.
    Each set can range from 0 to 255.

2. IPV6
    This type of addresses are much longer than IPv4 addresses and are represented as eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.
    IPv6 addresses were introduced to address the limitations of IPv4, particularly the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses. 
Localhost
This is a loopback network that typically points back to itself.

Subnet
This is a division of IP addresses into smaller, more manageable parts.

Data Transfer Protocols
There are two common data transfer protocols used in the Internet Protocol:

1. Transmission Control Protocol

   This is connection control protocol that ensures data packets are transfered in sequence and lost/corrupted packets are retransmitted.

2. User Datagram Protocol

   This is a connection-less protocol that transfers packets from one device to the other.
Ports
This is a virtual communication endpoint that allows application/services to communicate with each other in a network.

Common ports
HTTP (web traffic) - port 80
HTTPS (secure web traffic) - port 443
Secure Shell - port 22
Internet Control Message Protocol
This is a protocol used to send error, control and information messages between network devices.
